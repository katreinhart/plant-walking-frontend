## ABOUT  
Kat, Rebecca, and Sean created Garden Walk as a Quarter 3 project for Galvanize's Full Stack Web Development program. Our goals were to both learn React and motivate people to walk more by rewarding users with an adorable garden they could grow with their steps.

## NEXT STEPS
Currently, users must input their steps to make the plant grow. Our vision for this web app is to connect it to a pedometer API so that steps are added automatically.  

This web app is also ripe for social sharing. We'd like to make it easy for users to share their plants with friends.  

User authorization is also in need of additional validation checks.
